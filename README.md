Welcome back to the UCC Robotics (Team 9651) Code Repository, still the place where we keep all of our code for competitions and testing, as well as other related files.

Please check [the wiki](https://github.com/9651-Robotics/2016-2017_RobotC/wiki) for software help.

## Folder Overview

* `9651_S` All code pretaining to Robot 9651_S
* `9651_X` All code pretaining to Robot 9651_X
* `9651_Y` All code pretaining to Robot 9651_Y
* `GameDocs` Contains all offical .PDFs released by V3X about the game, such as the manual and appendices.
* `OldCode` Contains all the code from last year's repository, including experimental code.
  * `BrokenCode` This should be self-explanitory. 
  * `Competition` Code that was written for previous competition robots; most likley will contain a set of autonomous instructions at the top, as well as fully functional drivetrain and arm programming.
  * `Reference` is a mixture of RobotC sample code and unneeded working code, both of which demonstrate how to implement features such as sensors and pneumatics.
* `SpeakerSongs` Contains unconverted .TXT files which can be converted into RobotC functions within the "RTTTF (Ring Tone Text Transfer Format) Converter Utility" located within the RobotC IDE. Will not do anything without an attached speaker module.
